**This project is developed specifically for the ease and comfort of serving Wildlife enthusiasts and Environmentalists.
There are thousands of flower species in existence, thus it is difficult to understand and detect the traits and features of every single flower.
This is a web application that is capable enough to detect flower species through their images.
The user only needs to upload the image of the flower in the application and in the backend, the Exclusively coded Deep Learning model from Jupyter Notebook will predict the Flower from its corresponding patterns and characteristic traits.**
